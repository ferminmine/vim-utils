## Install
Just install vim in your OS, and then install the Plugin manager `junegunn/vim-plug`. Once you copy your preferred `.vimrc` configuration file in your home, you are ready to give the order to vim to install the plugins initiating vim and the writing `:PlugInstall`.

In Linux, to set Vim as the default text editor instead of Nano: execute the command `sudo update-alternatives --config editor` and choose vim.basic.

*Importat*: In Linux, to have a good and intuitive use of the clipboard just install the library with the command `sudo apt-get install vim-gui-common`.

### Section 2: Commands and Paste
- Copy Lines and Reordering: dd & p. No deleting. It's only cut in Vim, pasting is optional.
- Change Operator: `ciw` (change inner word) it's used to delete and replace a word. Another IMPORTANT operator is `ci<bracket|parenthesis|quote>` to delete and change ALL the CONTENT inside a parenthesis, bracket, quote, etc.

### Section 3: Jumps and Navigation
- Navigation: `gg` to go to the beggining of the file. `G` to go to the end of the file. `line_number + G`.
- Search: `/<text_to_search>` to search the occurrences after the current position of the cursor, to go to the next occurrence its needed to type `n` and to go to the previous occurrence `N`.

### Section 4: More Commands
- To create a new line wherever you are in the current line press `o`, `O` will open a new line in the line before.
